## Explanation

* The ant begins at 0,0 and initially makes a step to the cube in front of it. 
* Every time the ant steps on a cube, this cube changes its color. 
* Each color has a direction, meaning depending on the color of the cube the ant will turn left or right.
* Therefore, depending on how many colors you make available and which direction you assign to each color, the ant will create different colored cube-based patterns.
